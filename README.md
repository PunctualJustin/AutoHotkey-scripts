# AutoHotkey Scripts
Some useful AutoHotkey scripts I've written

### Alt Alt-Tab
When you're running Remote Desktop and want most of the functions to be passed to the remote computer, but still want to keep some for the local machine. i.e. Virtual Desktop switching shortcuts.

NOTE 1: Run this on the local machine with "Apply Windows key combinations" set to "On this computer".

NOTE 2: Win + D will only work when in full screen

### PrintScreen to Snipping Tool

Opens the Snipping Tool when you hit the print screen key.

### Volume Arrows

For those who don't have multimedia keys on their keyboard or just don't want to find them. Since most apps will have their own simple multimedia controls such as space to play/pause, volume is the only thing left
